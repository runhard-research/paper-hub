## One-liner
This paper presents a novel Mixture-of-Experts framework for object detection, incorporating adaptive routing among multiple YOLOv9-T experts to enable dynamic feature specialization and achieve higher mean Average Precision (mAP) and Average Recall (AR) compared to a single YOLOv9-T model.
