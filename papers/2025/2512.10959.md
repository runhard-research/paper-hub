## One-liner
We introduce StereoSpace, a diffusion-based framework for monocular-to-stereo synthesis that models geometry purely through viewpoint conditioning, without explicit depth or warping.

## Key Ideas
- We introduce StereoSpace, a diffusion-based framework for monocular-to-stereo synthesis that models geometry purely through viewpoint conditioning, without explicit depth or warping.
- To ensure fair and leakage-free evaluation, we introduce an end-to-end protocol that excludes any ground truth or proxy geometry estimates at test time.
- StereoSpace surpasses other methods from the warp & inpaint, latent-warping, and warped-conditioning categories, achieving sharp parallax and strong robustness on layered and non-Lambertian scenes.

## Notes
We introduce StereoSpace, a diffusion-based framework for monocular-to-stereo synthesis that models geometry purely through viewpoint conditioning, without explicit depth or warping. A canonical rectified space and the conditioning guide the generator to infer correspondences and fill disocclusions end-to-end. To ensure fair and leakage-free evaluation, we introduce an end-to-end protocol that excludes any ground truth or proxy geometry estimates at test time. The protocol emphasizes metrics reflecting downstream relevance: iSQoE for perceptual comfort and MEt3R for geometric consistency. StereoSpace surpasses other methods from the warp & inpaint, latent-warping, and warped-conditioning categories, achieving sharp parallax and strong robustness on layered and non-Lambertian scenes. This establishes viewpoint-conditioned diffusion as a scalable, depth-free solution for stereo generation.
