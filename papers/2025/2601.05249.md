## Key Ideas
- We present RL-AWB, a novel framework combining statistical methods with deep reinforcement learning for nighttime white balance.
- Our method begins with a statistical algorithm tailored for nighttime scenes, integrating salient gray pixel detection with novel illumination estimation.
- Building on this foundation, we develop the first deep reinforcement learning approach for color constancy that leverages the statistical algorithm as its core, mimicking professional AWB tuning experts by dynamically optimizing parameters for each image.
- To facilitate cross-sensor evaluation, we introduce the first multi-sensor nighttime dataset.
