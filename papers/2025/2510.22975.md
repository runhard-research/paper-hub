## One-liner

## Key Ideas
- VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($ν$), and density ($ρ$) throughout the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and voxelized.
- To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases, and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark.
- Experiments show that VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in accuracy and speed.

## Notes
Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often laboriously hand-crafted. VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($ν$), and density ($ρ$) throughout the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases, and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in accuracy and speed.
